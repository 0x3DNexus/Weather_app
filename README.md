This is a Beginner Level Weather App project made using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. 

This app is not meant for any commercial use by any means and is built for educational and learning purposes only.

The weather report is fetched from https://www.weatherapi.com/ which delivers proper data most of the time but may posses some "incorrect" data at times. Long story short its not 100% accurate !

The Search Option in this project is the simplest one and dosent use any type of filtering, search optimization or similar stuff. The value you enter is sent throught the api and may lead to incorrect data !
Search Results are truly based on what you search !!

The API key for this project is not provided hence you will need your own api key to make it work. https://www.weatherapi.com/ provides free api keys upon account creation and can be used for the same !
In the script.js file, just replace the ```API_KEY``` with your api key and it should work fine !

Additional Credits: 
@itsdstar (https://github.com/itsdstar) - For making the app responsive by making proper changes to the css file.
